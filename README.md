# Claude Code SDLC Wizard

A community-driven SDLC framework that becomes YOUR custom-tailored workflow.

## Philosophy

**Like a bespoke suit, this SDLC grows to fit YOUR project.**

The wizard provides generic principles. Claude Code adapts them to your stack, your patterns, your workflow. The more you use it, the more tailored it becomes.

### Core Ideas

- **Generic principles** - Focus on the "why", not tech specifics
- **Claude figures out the details** - Your stack, your commands, your patterns
- **Organic growth** - Each friction point is feedback that makes it better
- **Recursive improvement** - The system improves the system
- **Failure is feedback** - No pain, no gain

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

A core SDLC principle for all development work:

- **If something feels complex** - simplify another layer
- **If it's hard** - question WHY it's hard
- **Don't power through complexity** - step back and simplify

Applies to code, architecture, tests, and the SDLC process itself.

### Stay Lean, Stay Engaged

- **Human stays engaged** - keeps AI on track
- **Build trust** - as velocity increases, you trust the process more
- **Focus on what matters** - planning and confidence levels
- **When you reach velocity** - your brain focuses on high-leverage work

### Evolving with Claude Code

This SDLC adapts to Claude Code's improving capabilities. Claude periodically checks for better patterns, new features, and proposes updates. The pipeline keeps getting better.

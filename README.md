# Claude Code SDLC Wizard

A community-driven SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) framework designed for AI coding agents, specifically Claude Code.

## Philosophy: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

**No gist. No GitHub Action. Just a repo.**

- People copy-paste the wizard OR point to raw GitHub URL
- PRs for community contributions
- Zero infrastructure overhead

**If something feels complex, simplify another layer.**

## Using the Wizard

**Option 1: Copy-paste**
Copy `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` to your project and follow the setup instructions inside.

**Option 2: Raw URL reference**
Point Claude to the raw file when you want to set up SDLC:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaseInfinity/sdlc-wizard/main/CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md
```

**Option 3: Fork and customize**
Fork this repo and tailor the wizard to your needs.

## Staying Updated

No hooks or infrastructure needed. Just ask Claude:
> "Check if the SDLC wizard has updates"

Claude uses WebSearch to fetch the latest version and compare with your local copy.

## Core Principles

1. **Lightweight** - Less is more. Claude Code improves constantly; this should shrink over time.
2. **Scientific** - Based on what works, not opinions. TDD, integration testing, confidence levels - proven patterns.
3. **Philosophical** - The "why" matters more than the "how". Understanding principles > memorizing rules.
4. **Community-driven** - Your discoveries improve everyone's workflow.

## Contributing

**Pull requests are welcome and encouraged.**

This wizard evolves through collective wisdom. If you've discovered:
- A gotcha that burned you
- A pattern that works beautifully
- A simplification that reduces complexity
- A philosophical insight about AI-human collaboration

...please contribute it back.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md`
3. Submit a PR with a clear explanation of the "why"
4. Community discusses, best ideas get merged

### Decision Making

Changes are accepted based on:
- **Does it help?** Real-world value over theoretical elegance
- **Does it simplify?** Removing > adding
- **Is it generalizable?** Works across projects, not just yours
- **Is it philosophical?** Principles over prescriptions

## The Goal: Obsolescence

One day, Claude Code may have all this built-in. That's the goal. This wizard is scaffolding, not architecture. When it's no longer needed, we celebrate and archive it.

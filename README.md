# Claude Code SDLC Wizard

An organic **Secure Development Lifecycle** framework for AI coding agents. Makes Claude plan before coding, test before shipping, and ask when uncertain.

## What It Does

- Claude states confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) before implementing
- LOW confidence = Claude asks you instead of guessing wrong
- TDD enforced: failing test first, then implementation
- Self-review before presenting work
- Integrates with official plugins (`claude-md-management`, `code-review`, etc.)

## Why It Works

Human engineering practices (planning, TDD, confidence checks) happen to be exactly what AI agents need to stay on track. You set it up, Claude follows it.

**Think Iron Man:** Jarvis is nothing without Tony Stark. Tony Stark is still Tony Stark. But together? They make Iron Man. This SDLC is your suit - you build it over time, improve it for your needs, and it makes you both better.

## Organic & Dynamic

**This isn't a static rulebook.** The SDLC evolves with your project AND with Claude Code's capabilities:

- **Bespoke fit** - Starts generic, becomes tailored to YOUR codebase through use
- **Built-in improvement loop** - Friction is feedback; Claude proposes adjustments, you approve
- **Adapts to Claude Code** - As Claude Code adds features, the SDLC leverages them (or removes redundant custom solutions)
- **Token-efficient** - Uses Claude Code's native tooling (hooks, skills, plugins) to enforce the process with minimal context overhead
- **Checks and balances** - Confidence levels, self-review, and TDD gates catch problems before they compound

**The goal:** A living system that gets better the more you use it - not documentation that rots.

**The wizard is a setup guide, not a file you keep.** Run it once to generate your SDLC files, then check for updates periodically.

## Tests Are The Building Blocks

Tests aren't just validation - they're the foundation everything else builds on.

- **Tests >= App Code** - Critique tests as hard (or harder) than implementation
- **Tests prove correctness** - Without them, you're just hoping it works
- **Tests enable fearless change** - Refactor confidently because tests catch regressions

## Using It

**Copy-paste:** Download `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` to your project and follow setup instructions inside.

**Raw URL:** Point Claude to:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaseInfinity/sdlc-wizard/main/CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md
```

**Check for updates:** Ask Claude "Check if the SDLC wizard has updates" - Claude reads [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), shows what's new, and offers to apply changes (opt-in each)

## Auto-Update System

The wizard monitors Claude Code releases and community discussions automatically:

- **Daily:** Checks official releases, creates PRs for relevant updates
- **Weekly:** Scans community (Reddit, HN, blogs) for actionable insights

All updates require human review before merging. See `.github/workflows/` for details.

## Official Plugin Integration

The wizard integrates with Anthropic's official plugins:

| Plugin | Purpose | Scope |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `claude-md-management` | **Required** - CLAUDE.md maintenance | CLAUDE.md only |
| `claude-code-setup` | Recommends automations | Recommendations |
| `code-review` | PR review (optional) | PRs only |

**What the wizard still handles:** TDD enforcement, confidence levels, planning mode, feature docs, TESTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, hooks, skills - the full SDLC workflow.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Good contributions: philosophical insights, generalizable patterns, simplifications. Keep it generic - Claude figures out the tech specifics.

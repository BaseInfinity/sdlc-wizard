# Claude Code SDLC Wizard

A community-driven SDLC framework that becomes YOUR custom-tailored workflow.

## Philosophy

**Like a bespoke suit, this SDLC grows to fit YOUR project.**

The wizard provides generic principles. Claude Code adapts them to your stack, your patterns, your workflow. The more you use it, the more tailored it becomes.

### Core Ideas

- **Generic principles** - Focus on the "why", not tech specifics
- **Claude figures out the details** - Your stack, your commands, your patterns
- **Organic growth** - Each friction point is feedback that makes it better
- **Recursive improvement** - The system improves the system
- **Failure is feedback** - No pain, no gain

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Less is more
- If it's hard, question WHY it's hard
- Simplify another layer instead of powering through complexity

## Using the Wizard

**Option 1: Copy-paste**
Copy `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` to your project and follow the setup instructions.

**Option 2: Raw URL**

## Staying Updated

No hooks, no config. Claude uses WebSearch to compare versions.

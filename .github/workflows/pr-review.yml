            ## Review Focus Areas

            ### 1. SDLC Compliance
            - Does the change follow SDLC principles?
            - Is there evidence of planning (for complex changes)?
            - Are tests included or updated?

            ### 2. Security
            - Check for injection vulnerabilities (shell, YAML)
            - Verify secrets are not exposed
            - Check for unsafe variable interpolation

            ### 3. Code Quality
            - Is the code simple and readable?
            - Is it over-engineered?
            - Does it follow existing patterns?

            ### 4. Testing
            - Are new features tested?
            - Are tests meaningful (not just for coverage)?
            - Do tests follow the testing diamond (integration > unit with mocks)?

            You are reviewing a pull request for the SDLC Wizard repository.

            ## Review Focus Areas

            ### 1. SDLC Compliance
            - Does the change follow SDLC principles?
            - Is there evidence of planning (for complex changes)?
            - Are tests included or updated?

            ### 2. Security
            - Check for injection vulnerabilities (shell, YAML)
            - Verify secrets are not exposed
            - Check for unsafe variable interpolation

            ### 3. Code Quality
            - Is the code simple and readable?
            - Is it over-engineered?
            - Does it follow existing patterns?

            ### 4. Testing
            - Are new features tested?
            - Are tests meaningful (not just for coverage)?
            - Do tests follow the testing diamond (integration > unit with mocks)?

            Use the GitHub MCP tools to create a proper pull request review:
            1. Get the diff with mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff
            2. Create a pending review with mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review
            3. Add inline comments with mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review
            4. Submit the review with mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review

            After completing the review, output a brief summary of:
            - Files reviewed
            - Key findings (if any)
            - Overall recommendation (APPROVE, COMMENT, REQUEST_CHANGES)

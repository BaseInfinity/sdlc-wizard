# Changelog

All notable changes to the SDLC Wizard.

> **Note:** This changelog is for humans to read. Don't manually apply these changes - just run the wizard ("Check for SDLC wizard updates") and it handles everything automatically.

<!-- Test: Validating needs-review label bypass - this is a trivial docs change -->

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- Auto-update system for staying current with Claude Code releases
- Daily workflow: monitors official releases, creates PRs for relevant updates
- Weekly workflow: scans community discussions, creates digest issues
- Analysis prompts with wizard philosophy baked in
- Version tracking files for state management

### How It Works
GitHub Actions check for Claude Code updates daily (official releases) and weekly (community discussions). Claude analyzes relevance to the wizard, and HIGH/MEDIUM confidence updates create PRs for human review. Most community content is filtered as noise - that's expected.

### Files Added
- `.github/workflows/daily-update.yml`
- `.github/workflows/weekly-community.yml`
- `.github/prompts/analyze-release.md`
- `.github/prompts/analyze-community.md`
- `.github/last-checked-version.txt`
- `.github/last-community-scan.txt`

### Required Setup
Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to repository secrets for workflows to function.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- Idempotent wizard - safe to run on any existing setup
- Setup tracking comments in SDLC.md (version, completed steps, preferences)
- Wizard step registry for tracking what's been done
- Backwards compatibility for old wizard users

### Changed
- "Staying Updated" section rewritten for idempotent approach
- Update flow now checks plugins and questions, not just files
- One unified flow for setup AND updates (no separate paths)

### How It Works
The wizard now tracks completed steps in SDLC.md metadata comments. Old users running "check for updates" will be walked through only the new steps they haven't done yet.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- Official plugin integration (claude-md-management, code-review, claude-code-setup)
- Step 0.1-0.4: Plugin setup before auto-scan
- "Leverage Official Tools" principle in Philosophy section
- Post-mortem learnings table (what goes where)
- Testing skill "After Session" section for capturing learnings
- Clear update workflow in "Staying Updated" section

### Changed
- Step 0 restructured: plugins first, then SDLC setup, then auto-scan
- Stay Lightweight section now includes official plugin table
- Clarified plugin scope: claude-md-management = CLAUDE.md only

### Files Affected
- `.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md` - Add "After Session" section
- `SDLC.md` - Consider adding version comment

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- Tasks system documentation (v2.1.16+)
- $ARGUMENTS skill parameter support (v2.1.19+)
- Ike the cat easter egg (8 pounds, Fancy Feast enthusiast)
- Iron Man analogy for human+AI partnership

### Changed

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- Initial SDLC Wizard release
- TDD enforcement hooks
- SDLC and Testing skills

# Changelog

All notable changes to the SDLC Wizard.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- Idempotent wizard - safe to run on any existing setup
- Setup tracking comments in SDLC.md (version, completed steps, preferences)
- Wizard step registry for tracking what's been done
- Backwards compatibility for old wizard users

### Changed
- "Staying Updated" section rewritten for idempotent approach
- Update flow now checks plugins and questions, not just files
- One unified flow for setup AND updates (no separate paths)

### How It Works
The wizard now tracks completed steps in SDLC.md metadata comments. Old users running "check for updates" will be walked through only the new steps they haven't done yet.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- Official plugin integration (claude-md-management, code-review, claude-code-setup)
- Step 0.1-0.4: Plugin setup before auto-scan
- "Leverage Official Tools" principle in Philosophy section
- Post-mortem learnings table (what goes where)
- Testing skill "After Session" section for capturing learnings
- Clear update workflow in "Staying Updated" section

### Changed
- Step 0 restructured: plugins first, then SDLC setup, then auto-scan
- Stay Lightweight section now includes official plugin table
- Clarified plugin scope: claude-md-management = CLAUDE.md only
